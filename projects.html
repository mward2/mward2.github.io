            <h4>This Website</h4>
            <p>This website was coded using pure HTML and CSS and it is deployed through GitHub Pages. It serves as a portfolio for my work. I was the only person who worked on it.</p>
            <h4>SiteOwl Parts Database</h4>
            <p>This project was my Senior Capstone project. Out of the 6 people working on this project, 
                I was the only Front-End Developer. I was in charge of taking designs that were given to me 
                by the team's UI/UX Developer and turning them into code. We used Angular 8, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and 
                Node for this project and it was temporarily deployed through AWS. Due to COVID-19 and time 
                constraints, we weren't able to fully make our project public, though I've provided screenshots 
                below of what I produced.</p>

            <h2>Upcoming</h2>
            <h4>Farkle Scorer</h4>
            <p>The next project that I am working on is a score keeper for the game Farkle. 
                I play it a lot with my family and am tired of keeping score on paper. 
                I plan to create it using React or another Javascript framework and HTML and CSS 
                and use Heroku for deployment.</p>
